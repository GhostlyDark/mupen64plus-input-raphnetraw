# Raphnet raw Input plugin for Mupen64Plus
--------------------------------

## v0.9.3 - November 26, 2016

* Only handle channels supported by the adapter. This increases performance (reduces lag) by
  preventing meaningless attempts to communicate with controllers connected to non-existing
  ports on the adapter. It also fixes issues where games would see more than one controller was present.

## v0.9.2 - November 24, 2016

* Protect against invalid commands received from emulator. This fixes some games that failed to start.

## v0.9.1 - November 23, 2016

* Polling is now disabled only while a ROM is open.

## v0.9.0 - November 20, 2016

* Initial release
